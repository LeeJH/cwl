  - cross language

execution interface

tool interface
- simple to load/store



one-way or two-way conversion?
  - in
    - supports tools being written by larger community in other languages
    - might not have easy mapping for some concepts, such as secondaryFiles, expressions
    - writing parsers/decoders is a headache
    - encourages inconsistent landscape, hard to move between tools because languages are
      all over the map
      - encourages tool reuse
      - how hard is it to rewrite tools in a central language?
    - could leverage developer tools to convert from other workflow langs
  - out
    - might allow path to integration with existing/legacy tools that don't use the same lang

  - two-way is likely to be lossy



major theme is language coupled directly to engine


users:
- writing bash + SGE scripts
